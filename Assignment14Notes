Httpsession
    -> unique to ONE user, hence the storage confusion
    -> still save to the collection
    -> data stored in a session is unique to that user
        - like username
        -

@RequestBody annotation
    -> the front-end sends JSON data via username via the prompt
    -> this annotation instructs it to convert the JSON data into a User object
    -> Spring automatically maps it assuming the User class has a field "username"
